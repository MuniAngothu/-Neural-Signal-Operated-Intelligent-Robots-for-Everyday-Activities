1)From Refereences create a bunch of abstract 

 Developing Training Simulators and Educational Tools

->Develop a general-purpose BRI system that can perform various everyday tasks using
neural signals.
->Enhance the robot's ability to learn and adapt to individual users' intentions.
 ->Improve the efficiency of human-robot interaction through neural communication.



1)Literarure Review 
2)introduction(Referenece - base paper)


My thoughts:
1)EEG dataset
2)Decode the EGG what actually thinking 
modifiy:
use ai-ml as technology to decode the msg and pass to stimulater to do work
3)After decode,give input to stimulation through we chat
ex:EEG signal decoded as sit,then give input to robot with python language software
